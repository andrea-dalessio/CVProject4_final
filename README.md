#### About the models:
Baseline_SSD_MobileNetV3 is the first baseline implemented.\
FastRCNN+Recognition is the second baseline.\
All the files with "yolov8" in the beginning are test files with the separate training of YOLoO v8 by Ultralytics.\
"detection+pdl_pr" is the final implemented model as stated in the first paper.\
All models run on python 3.12 and require the CCPD-2019 dataset (whose link is found in the notebook themselves.\Kagglehub handles the download and install of it).\
Each model comes with its own set of trained weights, they are already assigned and ready to run for evaluation (make sure the dataset is correctly installed).\
